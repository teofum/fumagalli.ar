          It looks like you're accessing this website on a mobile device. While
          the site is meant to work on all devices, many applications' UI might
          not fit on a smaller screen. Using a computer or tablet is
          recommended.

          If you want to check out my articles and projects from this device,
          you can visit the static version of this site, intended for all
          devices. You can also continue to the desktop, but keep in mind some
          things may not display as intended.
