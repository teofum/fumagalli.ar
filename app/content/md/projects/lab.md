## About

This is a simple project set up as a scratchpad to quickly experiment with and iterate new ideas for UI designs and CSS or React things. Nothing in here is remotely production-ready, it's essentially my own digital sketchbook.

## Tech

**Next.js** â€” Chosen because it's super simple to set up and deploy to Vercel, plus I wanted to try out RSC and appdir.

## Status

Permanent WIP.

**Last updated** 2023
