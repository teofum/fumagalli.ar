# A Nikon D7000 Review

I've been shooting Nikon's D7000 pretty much ever since I got started into photography some four years ago. If you've seen my photos on this site, chance is they were shot with it, and one of two AF-D lenses (which I'll probably write about some other time).

This is a 2010 camera, so it was certainly already old news by the time I picked it up, and more so today. That said, I think it's still quite relevant, as we'll see in a minute. Now I've switched to a more modern camera—and system—with a new Canon EOS R6 Mk. II, I thought I'd write up something about the DSLR that got me started and that I've been using all this time.

Just to set the tone first, this isn't really a review as such—I'm not a reviewer, I have little experience with other cameras or systems and no claim to objectivity whatsoever. It's more of a loose collection of thoughts on a thing I like and my conclusions on whether it's worth buying used. If you're looking for proper reviews with specs, comparisons, sample images and so on, there's plenty of those from 13 years ago when this camera was released—that's not the point of this article.

With that out of the way: I think the D7000 is a fantastic little camera, and possibly Nikon's very best DX SLR together with its immediate successors, the 7100 and 7200, which are pretty much the same in every way that matters.

Back in 2011 when it was released, the D7000 was in a bit of an odd place: it was meant to replace the much older tech D90, but ended up such a good value proposition that it all but obsoleted the higher end D300 as well. The 7000 line would remain Nikon's top DX offering to this day, save for the pro-DX D500 which is more of a sidegrade.

I'm not going to go over the full specs, because they don't matter. There's a 16MP (more than enough pixels) DX (1.5x crop) sensor, a good for the time image processor and who knows what else. What does matter is how a camera actually shoots, and this is where the D7000 really shines, because it shoots _great_. Let's go over why.

## Ergonomics

Far from the cheap, plasticky D3000 and 5000 series, the D7000 feels extremely solid, because it is: it's a very well built camera with a mostly-metal body, more like a scaled-down version of Nikon's full-frame cameras than the entry-level DX.

The body is compact but comfortable: it fits nicely in your hand, and most controls are exactly where you'd expect. Everything you need to use when shooting is right there under your thumb and index finger, as you'd expect from a proper camera, not hidden behind menus and multi-function buttons like it often is in cheaper models.

The finder is great: it's big and bright as DX finders go. Of course, it's nowhere near as large as its full-frame counterparts, but that's to be expected when you're working with the smaller image circle of DX lenses. Basic shooting information is displayed on a big, easy to read green LED display.

This all makes the D7000 a joy to shoot, because there's no fiddling about with setting menus and info displays. You just mount a lens and it's ready to go. It's a very fast camera, which matters because it means you don't miss the shot.

That's not to say it isn't without its quirks, though. Half the camera's buttons are on the left side, which is fine for playback, but annoying when shooting. Most notably among them is the ISO button, which means you can't change this setting one-handed. Exposure compensation is also set by holding a button awkwardly placed to the right of the shutter release, which is a shame because you'll be using it often—the D7000 likes to overexpose by one or two thirds in sunlight, blowing up highlights beyond recovery if you're not careful. Finally, the grip can get a little cramped with very large lenses, but you can't fault Nikon for that as it's bound to happen with such a small camera.

These are just some minor gripes with what is otherwise a great camera, though, and the only real issues I've found with its ergonomics in actual use.

## Performance

The D7000 makes great images, like most every other DSLR introduced after the mid 2000s. It's sharp and has the same excellent color rendition you'd expect from a Nikon.

Low-light performance is very good for its time, though it obviously won't come close to the crazy high ISOs of today's mirrorless. Colors look great all the way up to ISO 6400, but details start to get fuzzy around ISO 1600 and you'll lose detail in the shadows the higher you go, as with any digital camera. I shoot at ISO 800 or below whenever possible, and for the absolute sharpest results you'll want to leave it at the base 100.

Fast prime lenses go great with the D7000 for low-light photography: you don't need high ISOs if you can open to f/2, and small, light lenses let you keep the camera steady for perfect sharp images hand-held at relatively slow speeds.

Autofocus is good, if somewhat limited: it's very fast and precise even with old 1980s AF lenses, but lacks the flexibility of more modern systems. There's both single-shot (AF-S) and continuous (AF-C) modes, and 39 AF areas to select from covering most of the frame. The auto AF area mode works well, but isn't very smart, and simply focuses on the nearest object it finds. AF-C mode should be capable of some basic tracking, but personally I never touched it.

AF area selection is a little clunky with only four directional buttons, as with most DSLRs of the time. In actual shooting, I found the fastest way to focus is to ignore most settings and use only the center AF area, focus and recompose, using AE lock if needed. This is true for most DSLRs, only newer mirrorless cameras with their magical subject-detection AF are actually faster than center AF and a quick hand.

The biggest issue with the AF system is focusing on far away or small subjects: it likes to focus on any non-flat backgrounds instead, even if the subject seems to cover the entire AF area. This can be an issue with wide-angle lenses, which is why I often don't bother with AF with my 24mm in daylight conditions unless I'm shooting close up: I just leave it at f/8 so everything farther than a meter or two is in focus and forget about it.

Overall this is a very solid performer, and holds up very well even after 12 years. Low-light shooting and AF on fast moving subjects are its biggest weaknesses, and the same can be said for most cameras of the time.

## Lens compatibility

This is one area where the D7000 really shines: it works great with _every_ Nikon lens made since 1977. If they've been AI adapted, it works great with every lens all the way back to 1959! That's a nearly 65-year back catalog of optically and mechanically superb lenses, many of which can be found on ebay for absolute bargain prices.

There's an AF motor in the camera, so autofocus works flawlessly with all AF and AF-D lenses of the 80s and 90s. Nikon's cheaper DX SLRs don't have this, and can only autofocus with the newer AF-S lenses. These older lenses are just as fast and precise as the later AF-S, just not as quiet. So? SLRs are loud, go mirrorless if you want a stealth camera.

It also has an aperture feeler for compatibility with Nikon's AI system, which means manual focus lenses are great. If you tell the camera which model lens you're using, you get proper metering, EXIF data, and even aperture-priority auto exposure.

It won't focus with Nikon's newest AF-P DX lenses. So? Only three such lenses exist, one of which is a refresh of an AF-S kit lens.

## Conclusions

The D7000 shows its age at times, but it's held up extremely well and it's a great little camera. It's fun to shoot and makes great pictures. At this point you may be wondering why this old camera is still relevant at all twelve years later, and that's because of price.

You can find these used, in great condition, for as little as $200 to $300—many of them including a kit lens. Spend a while on ebay and you can get a D7000 body and two proper, full-frame, metal mount AF zooms for about the price of Canon's barebones T7 with a crappy kit lens. It's a heck of a deal, especially considering those lenses have already lost as much resale value as they ever will, meaning you can sell them for exactly as much as you bought them for if you go over to a newer system.

If you're looking to get into photography with a limited budget, this is a _much_ nicer alternative to a barebones T7 or the equally crappy (now discontinued) D3500. Plus, you get to feel good because you bought used and kept just that little bit more plastic out of a landfill. Everyone wins!

## Recommendations

The D7100 is similarly cheap, has more pixels, more AF areas, and somewhat better high ISO performance. It also works with the AF-P lenses, if that matters to you. They otherwise handle the same, so I would go for whichever you can find cheaper in better condition.

The D7200 performs even better in low light, but seems to go for closer to $500. I wouldn't bother if you're on a tight budget, I'd rather have a 7000 and better glass.

The newer D7500 is an inferior camera because it lacks an aperture feeler, so manual focus lenses won't even meter. It's also close to $1000, at which point you may as well go mirrorless with something like Canon's excellent R10 instead of buying into a dying system.

If you find one with a kit lens, go for one of the 18-55 zooms. It's a crappy plastic kit lens, but it's tiny, weightless and optically it's great. The bigger 18-105 looks more like a real lens, but it's built just as cheap and is heavier, larger, riddled with distortion and not nearly as sharp. There's better telephoto lenses for this camera, don't waste your money on this one. I haven't tried the 18-200, but I hear it's a great do-everything zoom if you don't mind the weight. If you happen to find one with a 35mm f/1.8 then go for it right away, this is a fantastic little lens and one of the best DX primes. I prefer the older 35mm f/2 AF-D because it's better built and works on full-frame cameras, but either works great on DX.
