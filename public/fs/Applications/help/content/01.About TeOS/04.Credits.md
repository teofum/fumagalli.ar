This site wouldn't be possible without the work of some awesome people and teams:

## Frameworks and Libraries

TeOS is built with [React](https://react.dev/), the awesome [Remix](https://remix.run/) framework and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Other libraries used:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), in my opinion the best styling framework out there (and I've tried a lot of them)
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), an amazing library of accessible, unstyled components for all those bits and pieces that are a pain to get just right
- [zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction), a beautifully simple state management library
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/)
- Many more libraries and utilities—huge thanks to all the package maintainers out there
