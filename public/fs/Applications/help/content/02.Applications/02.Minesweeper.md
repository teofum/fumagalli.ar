# Minesweeper

The classic game and time-honored work-avoidance tool, Minesweeper. Based on the version shipped with the Windows 9x family of operating systems.

## Controls

Click to reveal tiles. Right click to flag.

## How to play

The game is won by either revealing all non-mine tiles, or correctly flagging all mines (and no other tiles). You lose if you hit a mine, just like in real life. 

The number on a revealed tile indicates the number of adjacent tiles that contain mines.
