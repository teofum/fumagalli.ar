# About TeOS

TeOS is my personal website: part portfolio, part blog, part personal playground and showcase of my skills as a web developer. It's designed to resemble the desktop environments of the 1990s to early 2000s, especially Windows 9x.

The name is, of course, a bad pun on my own name, because _come on, it was right there_.

## Why?

Because, well, why not. I could build a trendy portfolio site like everyone else, but where's the fun in that? I don't have the flashy content to compete with cool product designers, so I might as well give my site a personal touch and show off my skills as a developer while I'm at it. After all, I find a site I'm impressed by every other day, but the ones I actually remember are always the ones that do something unique.

As for the retro theme, I've always been fond of the simple, utilitarian approach to UI in the Windows 9x line of operating systems. It's also a good way to make sure I'm not reworking my website's styling every two yearsâ€”trends shift and change, but retro cool stays cool.

And because I find explaining things almost as much fun as making things, these pages, and my articles, will often contain detailed explanations on how the different parts of TeOS work. Of course, the website is also an open source project, so if you're really curious you can always [take a peek under the hood](https://github.com/teofum/dither).

## But does it run DOOM?

Of course [it runs DOOM]().
