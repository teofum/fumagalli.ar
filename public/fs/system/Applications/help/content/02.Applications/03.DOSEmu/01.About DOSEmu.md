# DOSEmu

DOSEmu is a DOS emulator powered by [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/), able to run many DOS games within this site.

It is currently loaded with packages for DOOM and the 1990 racing game Stunts, a personal favorite of mine (special thanks to dad, for introducing me to it).

### Using DOSEmu

Simply launch a game from the desktop or Start Menu to play!

### Mouse capture

Some games capture the mouse pointer when active. Press [esc] to release the mouse.
