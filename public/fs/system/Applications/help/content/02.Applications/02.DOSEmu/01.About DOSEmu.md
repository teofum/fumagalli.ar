# DOSEmu

DOSEmu is a DOS emulator powered by [js-dos](https://js-dos.com/), able to run many DOS games within this site.

It is currently loaded with packages for DOOM and the 1990 racing game Stunts, a personal favorite of mine (special thanks to dad, for introducing me to it).

### Using DOSEmu

Simply launch a game from the desktop or Start Menu to play!

### Mouse capture

Some games capture the mouse pointer when active. Press [esc] to release the mouse.

### Is this even legal?

Probably? These games are all over 30 years old, considered abandonware, and widely available to play and download online. Hopefully no buzzkill lawyers show up asking me to take it down. If you're one of those buzzkill lawyers, I kindly request you fuck off and find something better to do with that fancy law degree than pester some guy having fun with decade-old games on a low-traffic website.
