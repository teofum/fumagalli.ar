# Using the File Explorer

The File Explorer UI consists of four parts: the main panel, the address bar, an optional side bar, and the status bar.

## The main panel

The main panel is where the contents of the current folder are shown. It has multiple view modes you can select from the View menu.

### Icons view

The default view. Items are shown as large icons in a grid.

### List view

Items are shown in a list with small icons and text, arranged in columns. Good for exploring folders with lots of items in a compact view.

### Details view

Items are shown in a list. Shows detailed information about each item, including file size and type.

### Tree view

The current folder is shown as the root of a tree structure, where items can be expanded and collapsed. This view lets you see the contents of a folder multiple levels deep without navigating to the folders inside it.

## The address bar

The address bar shows where you are in the file system, and allows quick navigation to other folders or files.

Click the name of a folder in the address bar to navigate to that folder. Click anywhere else to open the quick navigation menu.

### Quick navigation

The quick navigation menu lets you type in a path directly and see its contents. It can be used as a search bar or a navigation tool. While typing, you will see a list of items in the current directory matching what you type.

Use the up and down arrow keys to select items in the list. Press Enter to select an item. If the item is a file, it will be opened. If it's a directory, quick navigation will move to that directory (this acts as a form of autocomplete).

You can also click folders in the list instead of selecting them with the keyboard to open them directly and exit quick navigation.

## The side bar

The side bar can be toggled on and off with [View > Side Bar]. When on, it appears to the left of the main pane and shows a tree view of the entire file system, useful for quickly finding and navigating to a different location.

## The status bar

The status bar shows useful information about the current folder and selected item, if any.
